JUDGMENT
R.F. Nariman, J.
1.

The present group of cases arises out of two reference orders –

the first by a two-Judge Bench referred to in a second reference order,
dated 15.11.2017, which is by a three-Judge Bench, which has referred
the correctness of the decision in M. Nagaraj v. Union of India, (2006) 8
SCC 212, (“Nagaraj”), to a Constitution Bench.
2.

The

controversy

in

these

matters

revolves

around

the

interpretation of the following Articles of the Constitution of India:
―16. Equality of opportunity in matters of public
employment.—
xxx xxx xxx
(4-A) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State
from making any provision for reservation in matters
of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any
class or classes of posts in the services under the
State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes which, in the opinion of the State,
are not adequately represented in the services
under the State.
(4-B) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State
from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year
which are reserved for being filled up in that year in
accordance with any provision for reservation made
under clause (4) or clause (4-A) as a separate class
of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year
or years and such class of vacancies shall not be
7

considered together with the vacancies of the year
in which they are being filled up for determining the
ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on total number of
vacancies of that year.‖
xxx xxx xxx
―335. Claims of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes to services and posts.—The
claims of the members of the Scheduled Castes and
the Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into
consideration, consistently with the maintenance of
efficiency of administration, in the making of
appointments to services and posts in connection
with the affairs of the Union or of a State:
Provided that nothing in this article shall prevent in
making of any provision in favour of the members of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes for
relaxation in qualifying marks in any examination or
lowering the standards of evaluation, for reservation
in matters of promotion to any class or classes of
services or posts in connection with the affairs of the
Union or of a State.‖
xxx xxx xxx
―341. Scheduled Castes.—(1) The President may
with respect to any State or Union Territory, and
where it is a State, after consultation with the
Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the
castes, races or tribes or parts of or groups within
castes, races or tribes which shall for the purposes
of this Constitution be deemed to be Scheduled
Castes in relation to that State or Union territory, as
the case may be.
(2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from
the list of Scheduled Castes specified in a
notification issued under clause (1) any caste, race
8

or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or
tribe, but save as aforesaid a notification issued
under the said clause shall not be varied by any
subsequent notification.‖
xxx xxx xxx
―342. Scheduled Tribes.—(1) The President may
with respect to any State or Union territory, and
where it is a State, after consultation with the
Governor thereof, by public notification, specify the
tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups
within tribes or tribal communities which shall for the
purposes of this Constitution be deemed to be
Scheduled Tribes in relation to that State or Union
territory, as the case may be.
(2) Parliament may by law include in or exclude from
the list of Scheduled Tribes specified in a notification
issued under clause (1) any tribe or tribal community
or part of or group within any tribe or tribal
community, but save as aforesaid a notification
issued under the said clause shall not be varied by
any subsequent notification.‖

3.

We have heard wide-ranging arguments on either side for a

couple of days, raising several points. However, ultimately, we have
confined arguments to two points which require serious consideration.
The learned Attorney General for India, Shri K.K. Venugopal, led the
charge for reconsideration of Nagaraj (supra). According to the learned
Attorney General, Nagaraj (supra) needs to be revisited on these two
points. First, when Nagaraj (supra) states that the State has to collect
9

quantifiable data showing backwardness, such observation would be
contrary to the nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India,
1992 Supp (3) SCC 217, (“Indra Sawhney (1)”), as it has been held
therein that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are the
most backward among backward classes and it is, therefore, presumed
that once they are contained in the Presidential List under Articles 341
and 342 of the Constitution of India, there is no question of showing
backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes all
over again. Secondly, according to the learned Attorney General, the
creamy layer concept has not been applied in Indra Sawhney (1)
(supra) to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and Nagaraj
(supra) has misread the aforesaid judgment to apply this concept to the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. According to the learned
Attorney General, once the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
have been set out in the Presidential List, they shall be deemed to be
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and the said List cannot be
altered by anybody except Parliament under Articles 341 and 342. The
learned Attorney General also argued that Nagaraj (supra) does not
indicate any test for determining adequacy of representation in service.
According to him, it is important that we lay down that the test be the test
10

of proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the
population in India at all stages of promotion, and for this purpose, the
roster that has been referred to in R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab,
(1995) 2 SCC 745 can be utilized. Other counsel who argued, apart from
the learned Attorney General, have, with certain nuances, reiterated the
same arguments. Ms. Indira Jaising, learned senior advocate, appearing
on behalf of one of the Petitioners in C.A. No. 11816 of 2016, submitted
that Nagaraj (supra) needs to be revisited also on the ground that Article
16(4-A) and 16(4-B) do not flow from Article 16(4), but instead flow from
Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution. She further argued that claims
of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are based on a
reading of Articles 14, 15, 16, 16(4-A), 16(4-B), and 335 of the
Constitution. It was further submitted that a further sub-classification
within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is impermissible, as has
been held in Indira Sawhney (1) (supra) and in E.V. Chinnaiah v. State
of A.P., (2005) 1 SCC 394 (“Chinnaiah”). She argued that the decision
in Nagaraj (supra) would have the effect of amending the Presidential
Order relating to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, which would
violate Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution of India, as Parliament
alone can amend a Presidential Order. She concluded her argument by
11

saying that the exercise of reading down a constitutional amendment to
make it valid, conducted in Nagaraj (supra), was constitutionally
impermissible. Shri P.S. Patwalia, learned senior advocate, appearing on
behalf of the State of Tripura, reiterated some of the submissions and
added that Nagaraj (supra) and Chinnaiah (supra) cannot stand
together, which is why Nagaraj (supra) is per incuriam as it does not
refer to the judgment in Chinnaiah (supra) at all.

4.

On the other hand, Shri Shanti Bhushan has defended Nagaraj

(supra)

by

stating

that

when

Nagaraj

(supra)

speaks

about

backwardness of the ―class‖, what is referred to is not Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes at all, but the class of posts. Hence, it is clear that
backwardness in relation to the class of posts spoken of would require
quantifiable data, and it is in that context that the aforesaid observation is
made. He also argued, relying upon Keshav Mills Co. Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Income-Tax, Bombay North, (1965) 2 SCR 908,
(“Keshav Mills”), that a Constitution Bench judgment which has stood
the test of time, ought not to be revisited, and if the parameters of
Keshav Mills (supra) are to be applied, it is clear that Nagaraj (supra)
ought not to be revisited. Shri Rajeev Dhavan, learned senior advocate,
12

has argued before us that Nagaraj (supra) has to be understood as a
judgment which has upheld the constitutional amendments adding
Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) on the ground that they do not violate the
basic structure of the Constitution. According to him, since equality is
part of the basic structure, and Nagaraj (supra) has applied the 50% cutoff criterion, creamy layer, and no indefinite extension of reservation, as
facets of the equality principle to uphold the said constitutional
amendments, Nagaraj (supra) ought not to be revisited. According to the
learned senior counsel, ―creamy layer‖ is a matter of applying the
equality principle, as unequals within the same class are sought to be
weeded out as they cannot be treated as equal to the others. The whole
basis for application of the creamy layer principle is that those genuinely
deserving of reservation would otherwise not get the benefits of
reservation and conversely, those who are undeserving, get the said
benefits. According to the learned senior advocate, the creamy layer
principle applies to exclude certain individuals from the class and does
not deal with group rights at all. This being the case, Articles 341 and
342 are not attracted. Further, Articles 341 and 342 do not concern
themselves with reservation at all. They concern themselves only with
identification of those who can be called Scheduled Castes and
13

Scheduled Tribes. On the other hand, the creamy layer principle is
applied by Courts to exclude certain persons from reservation made from
within that class on the touchstone of Articles 14 and 16(1) of the
Constitution of India. He argued that even if it be conceded that creamy
layer can fall within Articles 341 and 342, yet the Court’s power to
enforce fundamental rights as part of the basic structure cannot be taken
away. Indeed, Nagaraj (supra) was a case pertaining to a constitutional
amendment and, therefore, Articles 341 and 342 cannot stand in the way
of applying the basic structure test to a constitutional amendment.

5.

Shri Rakesh Dwivedi, learned senior advocate, appearing in C.A.

No. 5247 of 2016, submitted that the crucial language contained in
Article 16(4-A) is that the word ―which‖ would show that Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes have to continue to be ―backward‖. If the
expression ―the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes‖ in Article
16(4-A) would be read as ―the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes employees‖, this would become even clearer. Therefore,
according

to

the

learned

senior

advocate,

continued

social

backwardness of the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes employees
has necessarily to be assessed. While making promotions to higher level
14

posts, it becomes clear that a Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe
employee may have cast off his backwardness when he/she reaches a
fairly high stage in a service, for example, the post of Deputy Chief
Engineer, at which stage, it would be open for the State to say that
having regard to the absence of any backwardness of the Scheduled
Caste/Scheduled Tribe employee at this stage, it would be expedient not
to reserve anything further in posts above this stage. Shri Naphade, Shri
Gopal Sankaranarayanan and other counsel followed suit and broadly
supported the arguments of Shri Dhavan and Shri Dwivedi.

6.

Since we are asked to revisit a unanimous Constitution Bench

judgment, it is important to bear in mind the admonition of the
Constitution Bench judgment in Keshav Mills (supra). This Court said:
―[I]n reviewing and revising its earlier decision, this
Court should ask itself whether in the interests of the
public good or for any other valid and compulsive
reasons, it is necessary that the earlier decision
should be revised. When this Court decides
questions of law, its decisions are, under Article
141, binding on all courts within the territory of India,
and so, it must be the constant endeavour and
concern of this Court to introduce and maintain an
element of certainty and continuity in the
interpretation of law in the country. Frequent
exercise by this Court of its power to review its
earlier decisions on the ground that the view
pressed before it later appears to the Court to be
15

more reasonable, may incidentally tend to make law
uncertain and introduce confusion which must be
consistently avoided. That is not to say that if on a
subsequent occasion, the Court is satisfied that its
earlier decision was clearly erroneous, it should
hesitate to correct the error; but before a previous
decision is pronounced to be plainly erroneous, the
Court must be satisfied with a fair amount of
unanimity amongst its members that a revision of
the said view is fully justified. It is not possible or
desirable, and in any case it would be inexpedient to
lay down any principles which should govern the
approach of the Court in dealing with the question of
reviewing and revising its earlier decisions. It would
always
depend
upon
several
relevant
considerations: — What is the nature of the infirmity
or error on which a plea for a review and revision of
the earlier view is based? On the earlier occasion,
did some patent aspects of the question remain
unnoticed, or was the attention of the Court not
drawn to any relevant and material statutory
provision, or was any previous decision of this Court
bearing on the point not noticed? Is the Court
hearing such plea fairly unanimous that there is
such an error in the earlier view? What would be the
impact of the error on the general administration of
law or on public good? Has the earlier decision been
followed on subsequent occasions either by this
Court or by the High Courts? And, would the
reversal of the earlier decision lead to public
inconvenience, hardship or mischief? These and
other relevant considerations must be carefully
borne in mind whenever this Court is called upon to
exercise its jurisdiction to review and revise its
earlier decisions. These considerations become still
more significant when the earlier decision happens
to be a unanimous decision of a Bench of five
learned Judges of this Court.‖
(at pp. 921-922)

7.

We may begin with the nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (1)

(supra). In this case, the lead judgment is of B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J.,
speaking on behalf of himself and three other learned Judges, with
Pandian and Sawant, JJ., broadly concurring in the result by their
separate judgments. Thommen, Kuldip Singh, and Sahai, JJ., dissented.
The bone of contention in this landmark judgment was the Mandal
Commission Report of 1980, which was laid before Parliament on two
occasions – once in 1982, and again in 1983. However, no action was
taken on the basis of this Report until 13.08.1990, when an Office
Memorandum stated that after considering the said Report, 27% of the
vacancies in civil posts and services under the Government of India shall
be reserved for the Socially and Economically Backward Classes. This
was followed by an Office Memorandum of 25.09.1991, by which, within
the 27% of vacancies, preference was to be given to candidates
belonging to the poorer sections of the Socially and Economically
Backward Classes; and 10% vacancies were to be reserved for Other
Economically Backward Sections who were not covered by any of the
existing schemes of reservation. The majority judgments upheld the
reservation of 27% in favour of backward classes, and the further sub17

division of more backward within the backward classes who were to be
given preference, but struck down the reservation of 10% in favour of
Other Economically Backward categories. In arriving at this decision, the
judgment of Jeevan Reddy, J., referred to and contrasted Article 16(4)
with Article 15(4), and stated that when Article 16(4) refers to a backward
class of citizens, it refers primarily to social backwardness (See
paragraph 774). Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, not being the
subject matter before the Court, were kept aside as follows:
―781. At the outset, we may state that for the
purpose of this discussion, we keep aside the
Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes (since they
are admittedly included within the backward
classes), except to remark that backward classes
contemplated by Article 16(4) do comprise some
castes — for it cannot be denied that Scheduled
Castes include quite a few castes.‖

In dealing with the creamy layer concept insofar as it is applicable to
backward classes, the last sentence of paragraph 792 also states:
―792. …… (This discussion is confined to Other
Backward Classes only and has no relevance in the
case of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes).‖
In the summary of the discussion contained in paragraphs 796-797, it is
stated, ―the test or requirement of social and educational backwardness
18

cannot be applied to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who
indubitably fall within the expression ―backward class of citizens‖.‖
Jeevan Reddy, J. then went on to state that in certain posts, of
specialities and super-specialities, provisions for reservation would not
be advisable (See paragraph 838). Ultimately, the judgment decided that
reservation would apply at the stage of initial entry only and would not
apply at the stage of promotion.

8.

It is important to note that eight of the nine learned Judges in

Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) applied the creamy layer principle as a facet
of the larger equality principle. In fact, in Indra Sawhney v. Union of
India and Ors., (2000) 1 SCC 168 (“Indra Sawhney (2)”), this Court
neatly summarized the judgments in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra), on the
aspect of creamy layer as follows:
―13. In Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 :
1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] on
the question of exclusion of the ―creamy layer‖ from
the backward classes, there was agreement among
eight out of the nine learned Judges of this Court.
There were five separate judgments in this behalf
which required the ―creamy layer‖ to be identified
and excluded.
14. The judgment of Jeevan Reddy, J. was rendered
for himself and on behalf of three other learned
19

Judges, Kania, C.J. and M.N. Venkatachaliah, A.M.
Ahmadi, JJ. (as they then were). The said judgment
laid emphasis on the relevance of caste and also
stated that upon a member of the backward class
reaching an ―advanced social level or status‖, he
would no longer belong to the backward class and
would have to be weeded out. Similar views were
expressed by Sawant, Thommen, Kuldip Singh, and
Sahai, JJ. in their separate judgments.
15. It will be necessary to refer to and summarise
briefly the principles laid down in these five separate
judgments for that would provide the basis for
decision on Points 2 to 5.
16. While considering the concept of ―means-test‖ or
―creamy layer‖, which signifies imposition of an
income limit, for the purpose of excluding the
persons (from the backward class) whose income is
above the said limit, in para 791, the Court has
noted that counsel for the States of Bihar, Tamil
Nadu, Kerala and other counsel for the respondents
strongly opposed any such distinction and submitted
that once a class is identified as a backward class
after applying the relevant criteria including the
economic one, it is not permissible to apply the
economic criterion once again and sub-divide a
backward class into two sub-categories. The Court
negatived the said contention by holding that
exclusion of such (creamy layer) socially advanced
members will make the ―class‖ a truly backward
class and would more appropriately serve the
purpose and object of clause (4).
17. Jeevan Reddy, J. dealt with the ―creamy layer‖
under Question 3(d) (paras 790, 792, 793 of SCC)
and under Question 10 (paras 843, 844). This is
what the learned Judge declared: there are sections
among the backward classes who are highly
20

advanced, socially and educationally and they
constitute the forward section of that community.
These advanced sections do not belong to the true
backward class. They are (para 790) ―as forward as
any other forward class member‖.
―If some of the members are far too advanced
socially (which in the context, necessarily
means economically and, may also mean
educationally) the connecting thread between
them and the remaining class snaps. They
would be misfits in the class.‖ (SCC p. 724,
para 792).
(emphasis supplied)
The learned Judge said: (SCC p. 724, para 792)
―After excluding them alone, would the class be
a compact class. In fact, such exclusion
benefits the truly backward.‖
(emphasis supplied)
A line has to be drawn, said the learned Judge,
between the forward in the backward and the rest of
the backward but it is to be ensured that what is
given with one hand is not taken away by the other.
The basis of exclusion of the ―creamy layer‖ must
not be merely economic, unless economic
advancement is so high that it necessarily
means social advancement, such as where a
member becomes owner of a factory and is himself
able to give employment to others. In such a case,
his income is a measure of his social status. In the
case of agriculturists, the line is to be drawn with
reference to the agricultural landholding. While fixing
income as a measure, the limit is not to be such as
to result in taking away with one hand what is given
with the other. The income limit must be such as to
21

mean and signify social advancement. There are
again some offices in various walks of life — the
occupants of which can be treated as socially
advanced, without further inquiry‖, such as IAS and
IPS officers or others in All India services. In the
case of these persons, their social status in society
rises quite high and the person is no longer socially
disadvantaged. Their children get full opportunity to
realise their potential. They are in no way
handicapped in the race of life. Their income is also
such that they are above want. It is but logical that
children of such persons are not given the benefits
of reservation. If the categories or sections abovementioned are not excluded, the truly disadvantaged
members of the backward class to which they
belong will be deprived of the benefits of
reservation. The Central Government is, therefore,
directed (para 793) to identify and notify the ―creamy
layer‖ within four months and after such notification,
the ―creamy layer‖ within the backward class shall
―cease‖ to be covered by the reservations under
Article 16(4). Jeevan Reddy, J. finally directed (see
Question 10) that the exclusion of the creamy layer
must be on the basis of social advancement and not
on the basis of economic interest alone. Income or
the extent of property-holding of a person is to be
taken as a measure of social advancement — and
on that basis — the ―creamy layer‖ within a given
caste, community or occupational group is to be
excluded to arrive at the true backward class. There
is to be constituted a body which can go into these
questions as follows: (SCC p. 757, para 847)
―We direct that such a body be constituted both
at Central level and at the level of the States
within four months from today. … There should
be a periodic revision of these lists to exclude
those who have ceased to be backward or for
inclusion of new classes, as the case may be.‖
22

(emphasis supplied)
The creamy layer [see para 859, sub-para (3)(d)]
can be, and must be excluded. Creamy layer has to
be excluded and ―economic criterion‖ is to be
adopted as an indicium or measure of social
advancement [para 860, sub-para (5)]. The socially
advanced persons must be excluded [para 861(b)].
That is how Jeevan Reddy, J. summarised the
position.
18. Sawant, J. too accepted (p. 553 of SCC) that ―at
least some individuals and families in the backward
classes, — however small in number, — gain
sufficient means to develop capacities to compete
with others in every field. That is an undeniable
fact‖. (emphasis supplied) Social advancement is to
be judged by the ―capacity to compete‖ with forward
castes, achieved by the members or sections of the
backward classes. Legally, therefore, these persons
or sections who reached that level are not entitled
any longer to be called as part of the backward
class, whatever their original birthmark. Taking out
these ―forwards‖ from the ―backwards‖ is ―obligatory‖
as these persons have crossed the Rubicon (pp.
553-54). On the crucial question as to what is meant
by ―capacity to compete‖, the learned Judge
explained (para 522) that if a person moves from
Class IV service to Class III, that is no indication that
he has reached such a stage of social advancement
but if the person has successfully competed for
―higher level posts‖ or at least ―near those levels‖,
he has reached such a state.
19. Thommen, J. (paras 287, 295, 296, 323)
observed that if some members in a backward class
acquire the necessary financial strength to raise
themselves, the Constitution does not extend to
23

them the protection of reservation. The creamy layer
has to be ―weeded out‖ and excluded, if it has
attained a ―certain predetermined economic level‖.
20. Kuldip Singh, J. (para 385) referred to the
―affluent‖ section of the backward class.
Comparatively ―such (sic rich) persons in the
backward class — though they may not have
acquired a higher level of education — are able to
move in the society without being discriminated
socially‖. These persons practise discrimination
against others in that group who are comparatively
less rich. It must be ensured that these persons do
not ―chew up‖ the benefits meant for the true
backward class. ―Economic ceiling‖ is to be fixed to
cut off these persons from the benefits of
reservation. In the result, the ―means-test‖ is
imperative to skim off the ―affluent‖ sections of
backward classes.
21. Sahai, J. (para 629) observed that the
individuals among the collectivity or the group who
may have achieved a ―social status‖ or ―economic
affluence‖, are disentitled to claim reservation.
Candidates who apply for selection must be made to
disclose the annual income of their parents which if
it is beyond a level, they cannot be allowed to claim
to be part of the backward class. What is to be the
limit must be decided by the State. Income apart,
provision is to be made that wards of those
backward classes of persons who have achieved a
particular status in society, be it political or
economic or if their parents are in higher services
then such individuals must be precluded from
availing the benefits of reservation. Exclusion of
―creamy layer‖ achieves a social purpose. Any
legislative or executive action to remove such
24

persons individually or collectively cannot be
constitutionally invalid.‖
In paragraph 27 of the said judgment, the three-Judge Bench of this
Court clearly held that the creamy layer principle sounds in Articles 14
and 16(1) as follows:
―(i) Equals and unequals, twin aspects
27. As the ―creamy layer‖ in the backward class is to
be treated ―on a par‖ with the forward classes and is
not entitled to benefits of reservation, it is obvious
that if the ―creamy layer‖ is not excluded, there will
be discrimination and violation of Articles 14 and
16(1) inasmuch as equals (forwards and creamy
layer of backward classes) cannot be treated
unequally. Again, non-exclusion of creamy layer will
also be violative of Articles 14, 16(1) and 16(4) of
the Constitution of India since unequals (the creamy
layer) cannot be treated as equals, that is to say,
equal to the rest of the backward class. These twin
aspects of discrimination are specifically elucidated
in the judgment of Sawant, J. where the learned
Judge stated as follows: (SCC p. 553, para 520)
―[T]o continue to confer upon such advanced
sections … special benefits, would amount to
treating equals unequally…. Secondly, to rank
them with the rest of the backward classes
would … amount to treating the unequals
equally.‖
(emphasis supplied)

25

Thus, any executive or legislative action refusing to
exclude the creamy layer from the benefits of
reservation will be violative of Articles 14 and 16(1)
and also of Article 16(4). We shall examine the
validity of Sections 3, 4 and 6 in the light of the
above principle. …‖
9.

The next judgment with which we are directly concerned is the

judgment in Chinnaiah (supra). In this case, the validity of the Andhra
Pradesh Scheduled Castes (Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000,
was challenged, and dismissed by a five-Judge Bench of the Andhra
Pradesh High Court by a majority of 4:1. The 15% reservation that was
made in favour of the Scheduled Castes was further apportioned among
four groups in varying percentages – Group A to the extent of 1%; Group
B to the extent of 7%; Group C to the extent of 6%; and Group D to the
extent of 1%. In the lead judgment on behalf of the Constitution Bench,
Hegde, J. set out three questions for consideration as follows:
―12. From the pleadings on record and arguments
addressed before us three questions arise for our
consideration:
(1) Whether the impugned Act is violative
of Article 341(2) of the Constitution of
India?
(2) Whether the impugned enactment is
constitutionally invalid for lack of legislative
competence?
26

(3) Whether the impugned enactment
creates
subclassification
or
microclassification of Scheduled Castes so as to
violate Article 14 of the Constitution of
India?‖
Article 341 was then referred to, in which the Presidential List of
Scheduled Castes is to be notified. Any inclusion or exclusion from the
said list thereafter can only be done by Parliament under Article 341(2)
(See paragraph 13). The Court then rejected the splitting up of
Scheduled Castes on the basis of backwardness into groups, and
distinguished Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) (See paragraphs 19 to 21). It
was then held:
―26. Thus from the scheme of the Constitution,
Article 341 and above opinions of this Court in the
case of N.M. Thomas [(1976) 2 SCC 310 : 1976
SCC (L&S) 227] it is clear that the castes once
included in the Presidential List, form a class by
themselves. If they are one class under the
Constitution, any division of these classes of
persons based on any consideration would amount
to tinkering with the Presidential List.‖
Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) was then referred to and distinguished as
follows:
―38. On behalf of the respondents, it was pointed out
that in Indra Sawhney case [1992 Supp (3) SCC
217] the Court had permitted subclassification of
27

Other Backward Communities, as backward and
more backward based on their comparative
underdevelopment,
therefore,
the
similar
classification amongst the class enumerated in the
Presidential List of Scheduled Castes is permissible
in law. We do not think the principles laid down in
Indra Sawhney case (supra) for subclassification of
Other Backward Classes can be applied as a
precedent law for subclassification or subgrouping
Scheduled Castes in the Presidential List because
that very judgment itself has specifically held that
subdivision of Other Backward Classes is not
applicable to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes. This we think is for the obvious reason i.e.
the Constitution itself has kept the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes List out of
interference by the State Governments.
39. Legal constitutional policy adumbrated in a
statute must answer the test of Article 14 of the
Constitution. Classification whether permissible or
not must be judged on the touchstone of the object
sought to be achieved. If the object of reservation is
to take affirmative action in favour of a class which
is socially, educationally and economically
backward, the State’s jurisdiction while exercising its
executive or legislative function is to decide as to
what extent reservation should be made for them
either in public service or for obtaining admission in
educational institutions. In our opinion, such a class
cannot be subdivided so as to give more preference
to a minuscule proportion of the Scheduled Castes
in preference to other members of the same class.
40. Furthermore, the emphasis on efficient
administration placed by Article 335 of the
Constitution must also be considered when the
claims of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
28

to employment in the services of the Union are to be
considered.‖
Finally, the Court held:
―43. The very fact that the members of the
Scheduled Castes are most backward amongst the
backward classes and the impugned legislation
having already proceeded on the basis that they are
not adequately represented both in terms of clause
(4) of Article 15 and clause (4) of Article 16 of the
Constitution, a further classification by way of microclassification is not permissible. Such classification
of the members of different classes of people based
on their respective castes would also be violative of
the doctrine of reasonableness. Article 341 provides
that exclusion even of a part or a group of castes
from the Presidential List can be done only by
Parliament. The logical corollary thereof would be
that the State Legislatures are forbidden from doing
that. A uniform yardstick must be adopted for giving
benefits to the members of the Scheduled Castes
for the purpose of the Constitution. The impugned
legislation being contrary to the above constitutional
scheme cannot, therefore, be sustained.
44. For the reasons stated above, we are of the
considered opinion that the impugned legislation
apart from being beyond the legislative competence
of the State is also violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution and hence is liable to be declared as
ultra vires the Constitution.‖
In a separate concurring judgment, Sinha, J., after referring to Indra
Sawhney (1) (supra) and the creamy layer concept in paragraph 95,
went on to state:
29

―96. But we must state that whenever such a
situation arises in respect of Scheduled Caste, it will
be Parliament alone to take the necessary
legislative steps in terms of clause (2) of Article 341
of the Constitution. The States concededly do not
have the legislative competence therefor.‖
It was then concluded:
―111. The Constitution provides for declaration of
certain castes and tribes as Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes in terms of Articles 341 and 342 of
the Constitution. The object of the said provisions is
to provide for grant of protection to the backward
class of citizens who are specified in the Scheduled
Castes Order and Scheduled Tribes Order having
regard to the economic and educational
backwardness wherefrom they suffer. The President
of India alone in terms of Article 341(1) of the
Constitution is authorised to issue an appropriate
notification therefor. The Constitution (Scheduled
Castes) Order, 1950 made in terms of Article 341(1)
is exhaustive.‖
Thus, the Court struck down the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes
(Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000.

10.

The judgment in Chinnaiah (supra) has been referred by a three-

Judge Bench to a larger Bench by an order dated 20.08.2014. This is
because, according to the three-Judge Bench, Chinnaiah (supra) is
contrary to Article 338 of the Constitution of India and Indra Sawhney
(1) (supra). Since the correctness of Chinnaiah (supra) does not arise
30

before us, we need say no more about this reference which will be
decided on its own merits.

11.

Close on the heels of this judgment is the judgment in Nagaraj

(supra). In this case, the addition of Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) were
under challenge on the ground that they violated the basic structure of
the Constitution. After referring to the arguments of counsel for both
sides, the Court held that equality is the essence of democracy and
accordingly, part of the basic structure of the Constitution (See
paragraph 33). The working test in the matter of application of this
doctrine was then applied, referring to Chandrachud, J.’s judgment in
Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain & Anr., 1975 Supp SCC 1 (See
paragraphs 37 and 38). After dealing with reservation and its extent, the
Court then went into the nitty-gritty of the constitutional amendments and
held as follows:
―Whether
the
impugned
constitutional
amendments violate the principle of basic
structure?
101. The key question which arises in the matter of
the challenge to the constitutional validity of the
impugned amending Acts is — whether the
constitutional limitations on the amending power of
Parliament are obliterated by the impugned
31

amendments so as to violate the basic structure of
the Constitution.
102. In the matter of application of the principle of
basic structure, twin tests have to be satisfied,
namely, the ―width test‖ and the test of ―identity‖. As
stated hereinabove, the concept of the ―catch-up‖
rule and ―consequential seniority‖ are not
constitutional requirements. They are not implicit in
clauses (1) and (4) of Article 16. They are not
constitutional limitations. They are concepts derived
from service jurisprudence. They are not
constitutional principles. They are not axioms like,
secularism, federalism, etc. Obliteration of these
concepts or insertion of these concepts does not
change the equality code indicated by Articles 14,
15 and 16 of the Constitution. Clause (1) of Article
16 cannot prevent the State from taking cognizance
of the compelling interests of Backward Classes in
the society. Clauses (1) and (4) of Article 16 are
restatements of the principle of equality under
Article 14. Clause (4) of Article 16 refers to
affirmative action by way of reservation. Clause (4)
of Article 16, however, states that the appropriate
Government is free to provide for reservation in
cases where it is satisfied on the basis of
quantifiable data that Backward Class is
inadequately represented in the services. Therefore,
in every case where the State decides to provide for
reservation there must exist two circumstances,
namely, ―backwardness‖ and ―inadequacy of
representation‖. As stated above, equity, justice and
efficiency are variable factors. These factors are
context-specific. There is no fixed yardstick to
identify and measure these three factors, it will
depend on the facts and circumstances of each
case. These are the limitations on the mode of the
exercise of power by the State. None of these
limitations have been removed by the impugned
32

amendments. If the State concerned fails to identify
and measure backwardness, inadequacy and
overall administrative efficiency then in that event
the provision for reservation would be invalid. These
amendments do not alter the structure of Articles 14,
15 and 16 (equity code). The parameters mentioned
in Article 16(4) are retained. Clause (4-A) is derived
from clause (4) of Article 16. Clause (4-A) is
confined to SCs and STs alone. Therefore, the
present case does not change the identity of the
Constitution. The word ―amendment‖ connotes
change. The question is—whether the impugned
amendments discard the original Constitution. It was
vehemently urged on behalf of the petitioners that
the Statement of Objects and Reasons indicates
that the impugned amendments have been
promulgated by Parliament to overrule the decisions
of this Court. We do not find any merit in this
argument. Under Article 141 of the Constitution the
pronouncement of this Court is the law of the land.
The judgments of this Court in Virpal Singh [(1995)
6 SCC 684 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1 : (1995) 31 ATC
813], Ajit Singh (I) [(1996) 2 SCC 715 : 1996 SCC
(L&S) 540 : (1996) 33 ATC 239 : AIR 1996 SC
1189], Ajit Singh (II) [(1999) 7 SCC 209 : 1999 SCC
(L&S) 1239] and Indra Sawhney [1992 Supp (3)
SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC
385] were judgments delivered by this Court which
enunciated the law of the land. It is that law which is
sought to be changed by the impugned
constitutional
amendments.
The
impugned
constitutional amendments are enabling in nature.
They leave it to the States to provide for reservation.
It is well settled that Parliament while enacting a law
does not provide content to the ―right‖. The content
is provided by the judgments of the Supreme Court.
If the appropriate Government enacts a law
providing for reservation without keeping in mind the
parameters in Article 16(4) and Article 335 then this
33

Court will certainly set aside and strike down such
legislation. Applying the ―width test‖, we do not find
obliteration of any of the constitutional limitations.
Applying the test of ―identity‖, we do not find any
alteration in the existing structure of the equality
code. As stated above, none of the axioms like
secularism, federalism, etc. which are overarching
principles have been violated by the impugned
constitutional amendments. Equality has two facets
— ―formal equality‖ and ―proportional equality‖.
Proportional equality is equality ―in fact‖ whereas
formal equality is equality ―in law‖. Formal equality
exists in the rule of law. In the case of proportional
equality the State is expected to take affirmative
steps in favour of disadvantaged sections of the
society within the framework of liberal democracy.
Egalitarian equality is proportional equality.‖
xxx xxx xxx
―104. Applying the above tests to the present case,
there is no violation of the basic structure by any of
the
impugned
amendments,
including
the
Constitution (Eighty-second) Amendment Act, 2000.
The constitutional limitation under Article 335 is
relaxed and not obliterated. As stated above, be it
reservation or evaluation, excessiveness in either
would result in violation of the constitutional
mandate. This exercise, however, will depend on
the facts of each case. In our view, the field of
exercise of the amending power is retained by the
impugned amendments, as the impugned
amendments have introduced merely enabling
provisions because, as stated above, merit,
efficiency, backwardness and inadequacy cannot be
identified and measured in vacuum. Moreover,
Article 16(4-A) and Article 16(4-B) fall in the pattern
of Article 16(4) and as long as the parameters
34

mentioned in those articles are complied with by the
States, the provision of reservation cannot be
faulted. Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) are
classifications within the principle of equality under
Article 16(4).‖
The Court then concluded as follows:
―121. The impugned constitutional amendments by
which Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) have been
inserted flow from Article 16(4). They do not alter
the structure of Article 16(4). They retain the
controlling factors or the compelling reasons,
namely, backwardness and inadequacy of
representation which enables the States to provide
for reservation keeping in mind the overall efficiency
of the State administration under Article 335. These
impugned amendments are confined only to SCs
and STs. They do not obliterate any of the
constitutional requirements, namely, ceiling limit of
50% (quantitative limitation), the concept of creamy
layer (qualitative exclusion), the sub-classification
between OBCs on one hand and SCs and STs on
the other hand as held in Indra Sawhney [1992
Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 :
(1992) 22 ATC 385], the concept of post-based
roster with inbuilt concept of replacement as held in
R.K. Sabharwal [(1995) 2 SCC 745 : 1995 SCC
(L&S) 548 : (1995) 29 ATC 481].
122. We reiterate that the ceiling limit of 50%, the
concept of creamy layer and the compelling
reasons, namely, backwardness, inadequacy of
representation and overall administrative efficiency
are all constitutional requirements without which the
structure of equality of opportunity in Article 16
would collapse.
35

123. However, in this case, as stated above, the
main issue concerns the ―extent of reservation‖. In
this regard the State concerned will have to show in
each case the existence of the compelling reasons,
namely,
backwardness,
inadequacy
of
representation and overall administrative efficiency
before making provision for reservation. As stated
above, the impugned provision is an enabling
provision. The State is not bound to make
reservation for SCs/STs in matters of promotions.
However, if they wish to exercise their discretion
and make such provision, the State has to collect
quantifiable data showing backwardness of the
class and inadequacy of representation of that class
in public employment in addition to compliance with
Article 335. It is made clear that even if the State
has compelling reasons, as stated above, the State
will have to see that its reservation provision does
not lead to excessiveness so as to breach the
ceiling limit of 50% or obliterate the creamy layer or
extend the reservation indefinitely.
124. Subject to the above, we uphold the
constitutional validity of the Constitution (Seventyseventh Amendment) Act, 1995; the Constitution
(Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000; the Constitution
(Eighty-second Amendment) Act, 2000 and the
Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2001.‖
12.

We now come to the Constitution Bench judgment in Ashoka

Kumar Thakur v. Union of India, (2008) 6 SCC 1. In this case, Article
15(5) inserted by the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Act, 2005,
was under challenge. Balakrishnan, C.J., after referring to various
judgments of this Court dealing with reservation, specifically held that the
36

―creamy layer‖ principle is inapplicable to Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes as it is merely a principle of identification of the
backward class and not applied as a principle of equality (See
paragraphs 177 to 186). Pasayat, J., speaking for himself and Thakker,
J., stated that the focus in the present case was not on Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes but on Other Backward Classes (See
paragraph 293). Bhandari, J., in paragraphs 395 and 633 stated as
follows:
―395. In Sawhney (1) [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 :
1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] the
entire discussion was confined only to Other
Backward Classes. Similarly, in the instant case, the
entire discussion was confined only to Other
Backward Classes. Therefore, I express no opinion
with regard to the applicability of exclusion of
creamy layer to the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes.‖
xxx xxx xxx
―633. In Indra Sawhney (1) [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217
: 1992 SCC (L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385],
creamy layer exclusion was only in regard to OBC.
Reddy, J. speaking for the majority at SCC p. 725,
para 792, stated that ―[t]his discussion is confined to
Other Backward Classes only and has no relevance
in the case of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled
Castes‖. Similarly, in the instant case, the entire
discussion was confined only to Other Backward
Classes. Therefore, I express no opinion with regard
37

to the applicability of exclusion of creamy layer to
the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes……‖
Raveendran, J., in a separate judgment, while referring to Nagaraj
(supra), held as follows:
―665. The need for exclusion of creamy layer is
reiterated in the subsequent decisions of this Court
in Ashoka Kumar Thakur v. State of Bihar [(1995) 5
SCC 403 : 1995 SCC (L&S) 1248 : (1995) 31 ATC
159], Indra Sawhney v. Union of India [(1996) 6
SCC 506 : 1996 SCC (L&S) 1477] and M. Nagaraj
v. Union of India [(2006) 8 SCC 212]. When Indra
Sawhney [1992 Supp (3) SCC 217 : 1992 SCC
(L&S) Supp 1 : (1992) 22 ATC 385] has held that
creamy layer should be excluded for purposes of
Article 16(4), dealing with ―backward class‖ which is
much wider than ―socially and educationally
backward class‖ occurring in Articles 15(4) and (5),
it goes without saying that without the removal of
creamy layer there cannot be a socially and
educationally backward class. Therefore, when a
caste is identified as a socially and educationally
backward caste, it becomes a ―socially and
educationally backward class‖ only when it sheds its
creamy layer.‖
The Court ultimately upheld the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment)
Act, 2005, subject to the creamy layer test to be applied to Other
Backward Classes. Bhandari, J. held that the amendment was not
constitutionally valid so far as ―private unaided‖ educational institutions
were concerned.
38

13.

At this stage, it is necessary to deal with the argument that

Nagaraj (supra) needs to be revisited as it conflicts with Chinnaiah
(supra). It will be noticed that though Nagaraj (supra) is a later judgment,
it does not refer to Chinnaiah (supra) at all. Much was made of this by
some of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants. It is
important to notice that the majority judgment of Hegde, J. does not refer
to the creamy layer principle at all. Chinnaiah’s judgment (supra) in
essence

held

that

the

Andhra

Pradesh

Scheduled

Castes

(Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000, which it considered, could
not further sub-divide Scheduled Castes into four categories, as that
would be violative of Article 341(2) of the Constitution of India for the
simple reason that it is Parliament alone that can make any change in
the Presidential List and not the State Legislatures. That this is the true
ratio of the judgment is clear from a reading of the paragraphs that have
been set out hereinabove. This being the case, as Chinnaiah (supra)
does not in any manner deal with any of the aspects on which the
constitutional amendments in Nagaraj’s case (supra) were upheld, we
are of the view that it was not necessary for Nagaraj (supra) to refer to
Chinnaiah (supra) at all. However, it was further contended that apart
39

from this ratio, Chinnaiah (supra) also decided that the sub-classification
of Scheduled Castes, created by the Andhra Pradesh Scheduled Castes
(Rationalisation of Reservations) Act, 2000, also violated Article 14 of the
Constitution of India. This was stated by Chinnaiah (supra) to be
violative of Article 14 as the same would amount to tinkering with the
List, which, as was held, could be done only by Parliament and not by
State Legislatures. In our opinion, the true ratio of the judgment flows
from a construction of Article 341. It is true that the Andhra Pradesh Act
in question was also found to be violative of Article 14. We may only
state that Chinnaiah (supra) dealt with a completely different problem,
apart from dealing with a State statute and not a constitutional
amendment, as was dealt with in Nagaraj (supra).

14.

This brings us to whether the judgment in Nagaraj (supra) needs

to be revisited on the other grounds that have been argued before us.
Insofar as the State having to show quantifiable data as far as
backwardness of the class is concerned, we are afraid that we must
reject Shri Shanti Bhushan’s argument. The reference to ―class‖ is to the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and their inadequacy of
representation in public employment. It is clear, therefore, that Nagaraj
40

(supra) has, in unmistakable terms, stated that the State has to collect
quantifiable data showing backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and
the Scheduled Tribes. We are afraid that this portion of the judgment is
directly contrary to the nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra).
Jeevan Reddy, J., speaking for himself and three other learned Judges,
had clearly held, ―[t]he test or requirement of social and educational
backwardness cannot be applied to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes, who indubitably fall within the expression ―backward class of
citizens‖.‖ (See paragraphs 796 to 797). Equally, Dr. Justice Thommen,
in his conclusion at paragraph 323(4), had held as follows:
―323. Summary
xxx xxx xxx
(4) Only such classes of citizens who are socially
and educationally backward are qualified to be
identified as backward classes. To be accepted as
backward classes for the purpose of reservation
under Article 15 or Article 16, their backwardness
must have been either recognised by means of a
notification by the President under Article 341 or
Article 342 declaring them to be Scheduled Castes
or Scheduled Tribes, or, on an objective
consideration, identified by the State to be socially
and educationally so backward by reason of
identified prior discrimination and its continuing ill
effects as to be comparable to the Scheduled
Castes or the Scheduled Tribes. In the case of the
Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, these
41

conditions are, in view of the notifications, presumed
to be satisfied……‖
15.

In fact, Chinnaiah (supra) has referred to the Scheduled Castes

as being the most backward among the backward classes (See
paragraph 43). This is for the reason that the Presidential List contains
only those castes or groups or parts thereof, which have been regarded
as untouchables. Similarly, the Presidential List of Scheduled Tribes only
refers to those tribes in remote backward areas who are socially
extremely backward. Thus, it is clear that when Nagaraj (supra) requires
the States to collect quantifiable data on backwardness, insofar as
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are concerned, this would
clearly be contrary to the Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) and would have to
be declared to be bad on this ground.

However, when it comes to the creamy layer principle, it is important to
note that this principle sounds in Articles 14 and 16(1), as unequals
within the same class are being treated equally with other members of
that class. The genesis of this principle is to be found in State of Kerala
& Anr. v. N.M. Thomas and Ors., (1976) 2 SCC 310. This case was
concerned with a test-relaxation rule in promotions from lower division
42

clerks to upper division clerks. By a 5:2 majority judgment, the said rule
was upheld as a rule that could be justified on the basis that it became
necessary as a means of generally giving a leg-up to backward classes.
In paragraph 124, Krishna Iyer, J. opined:
―124. A word of sociological caution. In the light of
experience, here and elsewhere, the danger of
―reservation‖, it seems to me, is threefold. Its
benefits, by and large, are snatched away by the top
creamy layer of the ―backward‖ caste or class, thus
keeping the weakest among the weak always weak
and leaving the fortunate layers to consume the
whole cake. Secondly, this claim is overplayed
extravagantly in democracy by large and vocal
groups whose burden of backwardness has been
substantially lightened by the march of time and
measures of better education and more
opportunities of employment, but wish to wear the
―weaker section‖ label as a means to score over
their near-equals formally categorised as the upper
brackets. Lastly, a lasting solution to the problem
comes only from improvement of social
environment, added educational facilities and crossfertilisation of castes by inter-caste and inter-class
marriages sponsored as a massive State
programme, and this solution is calculatedly hidden
from view by the higher ―backward‖ groups with a
vested interest in the plums of backwardism. But
social science research, not judicial impressionism,
will alone tell the whole truth and a constant process
of objective re-evaluation of progress registered by
the ―underdog‖ categories is essential lest a once
deserving ―reservation‖ should be degraded into
―reverse
discrimination‖.
Innovations
in
administrative strategy to help the really untouched,
43

most backward classes also emerge from such
socio-legal studies and audit exercises, if
dispassionately made. In fact, research conducted
by the A.N. Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna,
has revealed a dual society among harijans, a tiny
elite gobbling up the benefits and the darker layers
sleeping distances away from the special
concessions. For them, Articles 46 and 335 remain
a ―noble romance‖ [As Huxley called it in
―Administrative Nihilism‖ (Methods and Results, Vol.
4 of Collected Essays).], the bonanza going to the
―higher‖ harijans. I mention this in the present case
because lower division clerks are likely to be drawn
from the lowest levels of harijan humanity and
promotion prospects being accelerated by
withdrawing, for a time, ―test‖ qualifications for this
category may perhaps delve deeper. An equalitarian
breakthrough in a hierarchical structure has to use
many weapons and Rule 13-AA perhaps is one.‖
The whole object of reservation is to see that backward classes of
citizens move forward so that they may march hand in hand with other
citizens of India on an equal basis. This will not be possible if only the
creamy layer within that class bag all the coveted jobs in the public
sector and perpetuate themselves, leaving the rest of the class as
backward as they always were. This being the case, it is clear that when
a Court applies the creamy layer principle to Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes, it does not in any manner tinker with the Presidential
List under Articles 341 or 342 of the Constitution of India. The caste or
44

group or sub-group named in the said List continues exactly as before. It
is only those persons within that group or sub-group, who have come out
of untouchability or backwardness by virtue of belonging to the creamy
layer, who are excluded from the benefit of reservation. Even these
persons who are contained within the group or sub-group in the
Presidential Lists continue to be within those Lists. It is only when it
comes to the application of the reservation principle under Articles 14
and 16 that the creamy layer within that sub-group is not given the
benefit of such reservation.

16.

We do not think it necessary to go into whether Parliament may or

may not exclude the creamy layer from the Presidential Lists contained
under Articles 341 and 342. Even on the assumption that Articles 341
and 342 empower Parliament to exclude the creamy layer from the
groups or sub-groups contained within these Lists, it is clear that
Constitutional Courts, applying Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution to
exclude the creamy layer cannot be said to be thwarted in this exercise
by the fact that persons stated to be within a particular group or subgroup in the Presidential List may be kept out by Parliament on
application of the creamy layer principle. One of the most important
45

principles that has been frequently applied in constitutional law is the
doctrine of harmonious interpretation. When Articles 14 and 16 are
harmoniously interpreted along with other Articles 341 and 342, it is clear
that Parliament will have complete freedom to include or exclude
persons from the Presidential Lists based on relevant factors. Similarly,
Constitutional Courts, when applying the principle of reservation, will be
well within their jurisdiction to exclude the creamy layer from such groups
or sub-groups when applying the principles of equality under Articles 14
and 16 of the Constitution of India. We do not agree with Balakrishnan,
C.J.’s statement in Ashoka Kumar Thakur (supra) that the creamy layer
principle is merely a principle of identification and not a principle of
equality.

17.

Therefore, when Nagaraj (supra) applied the creamy layer test to

Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in exercise of application of the
basic structure test to uphold the constitutional amendments leading to
Articles 16(4-A) and 16(4-B), it did not in any manner interfere with
Parliament’s power under Article 341 or Article 342. We are, therefore,
clearly of the opinion that this part of the judgment does not need to be
revisited, and consequently, there is no need to refer Nagaraj (supra) to
46

a seven-Judge Bench. We may also add at this juncture that Nagaraj
(supra) is a unanimous judgment of five learned Judges of this Court
which has held sway since the year 2006. This judgment has been
repeatedly followed and applied by a number of judgments of this Court,
namely:
a.

Anil Chandra v. Radha Krishna Gaur, (2009) 9 SCC 454
(two-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 17 and 18).

b.

Suraj Bhan Meena & Anr. v. State of Rajasthan & Ors.,
(2011) 1 SCC 467 (two-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 10, 50,
and 67).

c.

U.P. Power Corporation v. Rajesh Kumar & Ors., (2012) 7
SCC 1 (two-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 61, 81(ix), and 86).

d.

S. Panneer Selvam & Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu & Ors.,
(2015) 10 SCC 292 (two-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 18,
19, and 36).

e.

Chairman & Managing Director, Central Bank of India &
Ors. v. Central Bank of India SC/ST Employees Welfare
Association & Ors., (2015) 12 SCC 308 (two-Judge Bench)
(See paragraphs 9 and 26).

f.

Suresh Chand Gautam v. State of U.P. & Ors., (2016) 11
SCC 113 (two-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 2 and 45).

g.

B.K. Pavitra & Ors. v. Union of India & Ors., (2017) 4 SCC
620 (two-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 17 to 22).
47

Further, Nagaraj (supra) has been approved by larger Benches of this
Court in:
a.

General Categories Welfare Federation v. Union of India,
(2012) 7 SCC 40 (three-Judge Bench) (See paragraphs 2 and
3).

b.

Rohtas Bhankar v. Union of India, (2014) 8 SCC 872 (fiveJudge Bench) (See paragraphs 6 and 7).

In fact, the tests laid down in Nagaraj (supra) for judging whether a
constitutional amendment violates basic structure have been expressly
approved by a nine-Judge Bench of this Court in I.R. Coelho (Dead) by
LRs. v. State of Tamil Nadu and Ors., (2007) 2 SCC 1 (See
paragraphs 61, 105, and 142). The entirety of the decision, far from
being clearly erroneous, correctly applies the basic structure doctrine to
uphold constitutional amendments on certain conditions which are based
upon the equality principle as being part of basic structure. Thus, we may
make it clear that quantifiable data shall be collected by the State, on the
parameters as stipulated in Nagaraj (supra) on the inadequacy of
representation, which can be tested by the Courts. We may further add
that the data would be relatable to the concerned cadre.

48

18.

Dr. Dhavan referred to the judgment in U.P. Power Corporation

Ltd. (supra), and placed before us the Constitution (One Hundred
Seventeeth Amendment) Bill, 2012. This Bill was passed by the Rajya
Sabha on 17.12.2012 but failed to get sufficient number of votes in the
Lok Sabha and, therefore, could not become an Act. This Bill was tabled
close upon the judgment in U.P. Power Corporation Ltd. (supra), and
would have substituted Article 16(4-A) as follows:
―(4A) Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere
in the Constitution, the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes notified under article 341 and
article 342, respectively, shall be deemed to be
backward and nothing in this article shall prevent the
State from making any provision for reservation in
matters of promotions, with consequential seniority,
to any class or classes of posts in the services
under the State in favour of the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes to the extent of the
percentage of reservation provided to the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in the services of
the State.‖
The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the said Bill read as follows:
―The validity of the constitutional amendments was
challenged before the Supreme Court. The
Supreme Court while deliberating on the issue of
validity of Constitutional amendments in the case of
M. Nagaraj v. UOI & Ors., observed that the
concerned State will have to show in each case the
existence of the compelling reasons, namely,
backwardness, inadequacy of representation and
49

overall administrative efficiency before making
provision for reservation in promotion.
Relying on the judgment of the Supreme Court in M.
Nagaraj case, the High Court of Rajasthan and the
High Court of Allahabad have struck down the
provisions for reservation in promotion in the
services of the State of Rajasthan and the State of
Uttar Pradesh, respectively. Subsequently, the
Supreme Court has upheld the decisions of these
High Courts striking down provisions for reservation
in respective States.
It has been observed that there is difficulty in
collection
of
quantifiable
data
showing
backwardness of the class and inadequacy of
representation of that class in public employment.
Moreover, there is uncertainty on the methodology
of this exercise.‖
It will be seen that this Bill contains two things that are different from
Article 16(4-A) as already enacted. First and foremost, it clarifies that the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes that are notified under
Articles 341 and 342 shall be deemed to be backward, which makes it
clear that no quantifiable data is necessary to determine backwardness.
Secondly, instead of leaving it to the States to determine on a case to
case basis whether the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes are
adequately represented in any class or classes of posts in the services
under the State, the substituted provision does not leave this to the
discretion of the State, but specifies that it shall be to the extent of the
50

percentage of reservation provided to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in the services of the State. This amendment was necessitated
because a Division Bench of this Court in U.P. Power Corporation Ltd.
(supra) had struck down Section 3(7) of the Uttar Pradesh Public
Services (Reservation for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and
Other Backward Classes) Act, 1994 and Rule 8A of the U.P. Government
Servants Seniority Rules, 1991, which read as under:
―3. Reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled
Tribes
and
Other
Backward
Classes.—
(1)-(6)
xxx xxx xxx
(7) If, on the date of commencement of
this Act, reservation was in force under
government orders for appointment to
posts to be filled by promotion, such
government orders shall continue to be
applicable till they are modified or
revoked.‖
xxx xxx xxx
―8-A. Entitlement of consequential seniority to a
person belonging to Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled
Tribes.—Notwithstanding
anything
contained in Rules 6, 7 or 8 of these Rules, a
person belonging to the Scheduled Castes or
Scheduled Tribes shall, on his promotion by virtue of
rule
of
reservation/roster,
be entitled to
consequential seniority also.‖

51

This Court considered Nagaraj (supra) in detail and in paragraph 81,
culled out various principles which Nagaraj (supra) had laid down. We
are concerned here with principles (ix) and (x) in particular, which read
as under:
―(ix) The concepts of efficiency, backwardness and
inadequacy of representation are required to be
identified and measured. That exercise depends on
the availability of data. That exercise depends on
numerous factors. It is for this reason that the
enabling provisions are required to be made
because each competing claim seeks to achieve
certain goals. How best one should optimise these
conflicting claims can only be done by the
administration in the context of local prevailing
conditions in public employment.
(x) Article 16(4), therefore, creates a field which
enables a State to provide for reservation provided
there exists backwardness of a class and
inadequacy of representation in employment. These
are compelling reasons. They do not exist in Article
16(1). It is only when these reasons are satisfied
that a State gets the power to provide for
reservation in the matter of employment.‖

19.

We have already seen that, even without the help of the first part

of Article 16(4-A) of the 2012 Amendment Bill, the providing of
quantifiable data on backwardness when it comes to Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes, has already been held by us to be contrary to the
majority in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra). So far as the second part of the
52

substituted Article 16(4-A) contained in the Bill is concerned, we may
notice that the proportionality to the population of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes is not something that occurs in Article 16(4-A) as
enacted, which must be contrasted with Article 330. We may only add
that Article 46, which is a provision occurring in the Directive Principles of
State Policy, has always made the distinction between the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections of the
people. Article 46 reads as follows:
―46. Promotion of educational and economic
interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes
and other weaker sections.—The State shall
promote with special care the educational and
economic interests of the weaker sections of the
people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled Castes
and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them
from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.‖

This being the case, it is easy to see the pattern of Article 46 being
followed in Article 16(4) and Article 16(4-A). Whereas ―backward
classes‖ in Article 16(4) is equivalent to the ―weaker sections of the
people‖ in Article 46, and is the overall genus, the species of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes is separately mentioned in the latter part of
Article 46 and Article 16(4-A). This is for the reason, as has been pointed
53

out by us earlier, that the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes
are the most backward or the weakest of the weaker sections of society,
and are, therefore, presumed to be backward. Shri Dwivedi’s argument
that as a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe reaches
the higher posts, he/she no longer has the taint of either untouchability or
backwardness, as the case may be, and that therefore, the State can
judge the absence of backwardness as the posts go higher, is an
argument that goes to the validity of Article 16(4-A). If we were to accept
this argument, logically, we would have to strike down Article 16(4-A), as
the necessity for continuing reservation for a Scheduled Caste and/or
Scheduled Tribe member in the higher posts would then disappear.
Since the object of Article 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) is to do away with the
nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) when it came to
reservation in promotions in favour of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes, that object must be given effect to, and has been
given effect by the judgment in Nagaraj (supra). This being the case, we
cannot countenance an argument which would indirectly revisit the basis
or foundation of the constitutional amendments themselves, in order that
one small part of Nagaraj (supra) be upheld, namely, that there be
quantifiable data for judging backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and
54

the Scheduled Tribes in promotional posts. We may hasten to add that
Shri Dwivedi’s argument cannot be confused with the concept of ―creamy
layer‖ which, as has been pointed out by us hereinabove, applies to
persons within the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes who no
longer require reservation, as opposed to posts beyond the entry stage,
which may be occupied by members of the Scheduled Castes or the
Scheduled Tribes.

20.

The learned Attorney General also requested us to lay down that

the proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the
population of India should be taken to be the test for determining whether
they are adequately represented in promotional posts for the purpose of
Article 16(4-A). He complained that Nagaraj (supra) ought to have stated
this, but has said nothing on this aspect. According to us, Nagaraj
(supra) has

wisely left

the test for determining adequacy of

representation in promotional posts to the States for the simple reason
that as the post gets higher, it may be necessary, even if a
proportionality test to the population as a whole is taken into account, to
reduce the number of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in
promotional posts, as one goes upwards. This is for the simple reason
55

that efficiency of administration has to be looked at every time
promotions are made. As has been pointed out by B.P. Jeevan Reddy,
J.’s judgment in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra), there may be certain posts
right at the top, where reservation is impermissible altogether. For this
reason, we make it clear that Article 16(4-A) has been couched in
language which would leave it to the States to determine adequate
representation depending upon the promotional post that is in question.
For this purpose, the contrast of Article 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) with Article
330 of the Constitution is important. Article 330 reads as follows:
―330. Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes in the House of the
People.—(1) Seats shall be reserved in the House
of the People for—
(a) the Scheduled Castes;
(b) the Scheduled Tribes except the Scheduled
Tribes in the autonomous districts of Assam;
and]
(c) the Scheduled Tribes in the autonomous
districts of Assam.
(2) The number of seats reserved in any State or
Union territory for the Scheduled Castes or the
Scheduled Tribes under clause (1) shall bear, as
nearly as may be, the same proportion to the total
number of seats allotted to that State or Union
territory in the House of the People as the
population of the Scheduled Castes in the State or
Union territory or of the Scheduled Tribes in the
State or Union territory or part of the State or Union
56

territory, as the case may be, in respect of which
seats are so reserved, bears to the total population
of the State or Union territory.
(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause
(2), the number of seats reserved in the House of
the People for the Scheduled Tribes in the
autonomous districts of Assam shall bear to the total
number of seats allotted to that State a proportion
not less than the population of the Scheduled Tribes
in the said autonomous districts bears to the total
population of the State.
Explanation.—In this article and in Article 332, the
expression ―population‖ means the population as
ascertained at the last preceding census of which
the relevant figures have been published:
Provided that the reference in this Explanation to the
last preceding census of which the relevant figures
have been published shall, until the relevant figures
for the first census taken after the year 2026 have
been published, be construed as a reference to
the 2001 census.‖
It can be seen that when seats are to be reserved in the House of the
People for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the test of
proportionality to the population is mandated by the Constitution. The
difference in language between this provision and Article 16(4-A) is
important, and we decline the invitation of the learned Attorney General
to say any more in this behalf.

57

21.

Thus, we conclude that the judgment in Nagaraj (supra) does not

need to be referred to a seven–Judge Bench. However, the conclusion in
Nagaraj (supra) that the State has to collect quantifiable data showing
backwardness of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, being
contrary to the nine-Judge Bench in Indra Sawhney (1) (supra) is held to
be invalid to this extent.
