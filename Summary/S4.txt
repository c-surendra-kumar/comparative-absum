TEHSEEN S. POONAWALLA V. UNION OF INDIA
2018 INSC 617 (17 July 2018)
Justices:  
Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justice Ajay M. Khanwilkar, Justice (Dr.) Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud
Question(s):  
(i) Whether acts of lynching, where private individuals take the law into their own hands, is legal within India’s justice administration system. (ii) If not, what steps need to be taken to curtail such activities?

Factual Background:  
The Petitioner is a social activist who filed writ petitions in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution seeking direction against violence by cow vigilantes and the removal of violent content from social media uploaded by such groups. Further, the Petition challenged Section 12 of the Gujarat Animal Prevention Act, 1954, Section 13 of the Maharashtra Animal Prevention Act, 1976, and Section 15 of the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964 as unconstitutional. These sections provide that no legal proceeding will be instituted against any person for anything which is in good faith under the Act. The Petitioners contended that these provisions were being misused to protect cow vigilantes from prosecution, even when they committed violent acts under the pretext of protecting cattle.
Decision of the Supreme Court:  
A Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously held that the act of lynching is unlawful. No individual has the authority to enforce the law and punish fellow citizens by their own hands. The Court held that it is the task of the law to provide a procedure for arrest, investigation, and trial. The State is obligated to ensure the protection of the fundamental rights and liberties of every individual, regardless of their race, caste, class, or religion. The State is also responsible for promoting a secular, inclusive, and diverse societal framework. Further, the Court issued guidelines to curb the menace of vigilantism. However, the Court did not address the constitutional validity of the immunity provisions in the statutes challenged. The judgment was authored by Chief Justice Misra.
Reasons for the Decision:  
Duty of the State to eradicate vigilantism

The Supreme Court agreed with the submission of the Petitioner that no vigilante group can engage in lynching. The Court held that every individual has the right to report violations of the law to the police. It is the duty of the State to prevent crime and maintain public order. No one has the authority to take law enforcement into their own hands (¶15). Simultaneously, accused persons are entitled to a fair and speedy trial under the constitutional and statutory provisions. The judiciary is tasked with adjudicating and determining the guilt or innocence of a person. The Court held that justice is administered within courtrooms, not on the streets (¶15). 



The Supreme Court referred to Mohd. Haroon v. Union of India (2014 INSC 210), where the Supreme Court had held that the responsibility to prevent the recurrence of communal violence lies on the shoulders of the state administration (¶16). Further, any officer tasked with the maintenance of law and order will face legal consequences if found negligent (¶16). The State should find the cause behind the communal violence, strengthen police infrastructure, and initiate peace-building measures to curb communal violence (¶16). 



The Supreme Court held that the authorities are entrusted with upholding law and order and bear the primary duty to ensure that vigilantism, whether related to cow protection or any other cause, is prevented from occurring (¶17). Vigilantism undermines the legal and formal institutions of the State (¶18). The Court agreed with the submission of the Petitioner that if a law prescribes punishment, it provides mechanisms as well. It also found that allegations of cattle smuggling or cruel treatment of animals will be prevented and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies (¶¶17, 18).  



The Supreme Court held that vigilantism by mobs has to be prevented by the government and by society. Intolerance and polarisation, which is expressed through mobs, cannot be normalized (¶¶19-20). The freedom of speech and expression guarantees plurality of voices which is one of the essential foundations of liberal democracy (¶21). The State has an obligation to safeguard its citizens from vigilantism and lynching. (¶¶19-21). 



Guidelines



Lastly, the Supreme Court recommended that the Parliament should create a separate offence of lynching which should be adequately punished (¶43), and the Court issued the following guidelines aimed at preventing and punishing all incidents of lynching and mob violence:



Preventive Measures- Designation of senior police officers as Nodal Officers in each district to prevent incidents of mob violence and lynching; identification of areas with a history of lynching and mob violence; regular meetings with local intelligence units to identify vigilantism tendencies and prohibit dissemination of offensive material; police patrolling in sensitive areas to discourage anti-social elements; broadcasting on various media platforms that lynching and mob violence will have serious legal consequences; steps to curb dissemination of irresponsible messages on social media platforms;  registration of FIRs under Section 153A of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (promoting enmity between different groups) against individuals who post inciting content which is likely to incite mob violence and lynching (¶40).



Remedial Measures- Immediate lodging of FIRs by the jurisdictional police station in case of lynching or mob violence; personal monitoring of investigations by Nodal Officers to ensure effective handling and timely charge-sheet filing; preparation of Victim Compensation Scheme under section 357A of Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, considering bodily and psychological injuries, loss of earnings, and legal and medical expenses; fast-track trials in designated courts with daily hearings and conclusion within six months; maximum sentencing upon conviction to set a stern example; protection of witnesses and timely notice to victims or their next of kin about court proceedings (¶40).



Punitive Measures- Disciplinary action against police or district officials for negligence or misconduct in preventing, investigating, or facilitating the trial of mob violence and lynching cases; direction to take disciplinary action against officials who fail to prevent incidents despite prior knowledge or delay in apprehending culprits (¶40).
